# Contributing to EcoFlow Power Management

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Device Compatibility Testing

We especially welcome contributions that help us understand how this software behaves across the full range of EcoFlow devices. 

If you have a device that is not explicitly confirmed to work, please:
1. Try running the tools with your device.
2. Open an issue (using the [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) or [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template).
3. Provide details about your device model, firmware version, and the results of your tests.

This helps us build a robust compatibility matrix for the community.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/JoshuaDodds/ecoflow-power-management/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/JoshuaDodds/ecoflow-power-management/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We have a template that will help you include all this information.
